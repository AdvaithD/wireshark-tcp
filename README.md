## Wireshark // TCP

Digging into the TCP protocol (for school) and for fun.

### How?

- Analyze a trace of TCP segments sent / received transferring a file.
- Look at some key things: slow start, congestion avoidance, flow control mechanism.
- Analyse throughput and round-trip time of the TCP connectio (between host and server)
